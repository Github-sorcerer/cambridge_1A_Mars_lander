different best kh for 10km and 100km: finite propotion rate, it takes more time to brake when velocity high, so the probe may crash if kh high

Kh high: brake at higher speed, and brake time is shorter. may not decelerate before hit the ground
Kh low: brake more actively, takes more time and consume more fuel

Plot graph ignored. 

may use square root instead of linear function with regard to h in the error function.

fuel = fuel remaining
