euler needs smaller dt to achieve better simulation accuracy

orbit not stable; doesn't obey conservation of energy; it might be interesting to investigate why it seems that although the energy increases, it will return to the same initial point in every round(See ellipse 4500) no prosession

agrees with theory and verlet on the critical values
