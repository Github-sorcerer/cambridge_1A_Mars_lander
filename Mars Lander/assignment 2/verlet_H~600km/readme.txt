regard mars as a point mass and no collision considered.

if run v=0, it will goes to infinite eventually instead of 0 because of extremely high acceleration near the point mass requires a higher time difference than dt=1.0s. The sattelite pass through the centre very fast that the acceleration cannot be regard constant at dt=1

possible solution: dt changes with a as a*dt=1; may take infinite time at the centre

because it's not the ful story of the phisical model(i.e. not point mass) and acceleration below surface is not a concern, this will cause no problem
